Am I not me?
What can I see?
Everything around me
Spins around me
I have seen
The tears in your eyes
I have seen
The tears in your eyes

Only way to fight this thing
Is to face it head on
… two guns shooting through vest
… to hell and back …

Am I not me?
What can I see?
Everything around me
Spins around me
I have seen
The tears in your eyes
I have seen
The tears in your eyes

Yeah, second verse …

Am I not me?
What can I see?
Everything around me
Spins around me
I have seen
The tears in your eyes
I have seen
The tears in your eyes

…
On and on, on and on
